# InnoPilot Authentication Implementation Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the detailed implementation plan for adding authentication functionality to the InnoPilot VS Code extension. The authentication system is designed to be optional, allowing users to access core functionality without requiring login while providing enhanced features for authenticated users.

## Implementation Phases

The authentication feature is divided into six implementation phases, each with its own detailed documentation:

1. [Infrastructure Setup](./phase1-infrastructure.md)
   - Authentication service module
   - Secure storage utilities
   - Authentication state management
   - Event system for auth state changes

2. [Anonymous/Guest Mode](./phase2-anonymous-mode.md)
   - Default anonymous mode implementation
   - User settings for anonymous preferences
   - Core functionality in anonymous mode
   - Telemetry for anonymous usage

3. [Authentication UI](./phase3-authentication-ui.md)
   - Login modal/webview
   - Status bar indicator
   - Command palette integration
   - Non-intrusive login prompts

4. [Authentication Logic](./phase4-authentication-logic.md)
   - Email/password authentication flow
   - JWT token handling and storage
   - Refresh token mechanism
   - Session timeout handling

5. [User Profile](./phase5-user-profile.md)
   - User profile view
   - User settings synchronization
   - Account management options

6. [Testing & Polish](./phase6-testing-polish.md)
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - User acceptance testing
   - Bug fixing and UX improvements

## Implementation Principles

Throughout the implementation, we will adhere to the following principles:

- **Optional Authentication**: Core functionality will be available without login
- **Functional Programming**: Use functional and declarative patterns, avoid classes
- **Clean Organization**: Structure code with clear separation of concerns
- **Non-Intrusive UX**: Login prompts will be contextual and non-disruptive
- **Security First**: Implement secure token storage and handling
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all aspects of the authentication system

## Directory Structure

The authentication system will be implemented in the following directory structure:

```
src/
└── auth/
    ├── api/
    │   └── authClient.ts
    ├── ui/
    │   ├── loginWebview.ts
    │   ├── profileWebview.ts
    │   ├── statusBar.ts
    │   └── loginPrompt.ts
    ├── sync/
    │   └── settingsSync.ts
    ├── account/
    │   └── accountManager.ts
    ├── __tests__/
    │   ├── authService.test.ts
    │   └── authFlow.test.ts
    ├── authService.ts
    ├── secureStorage.ts
    ├── tokenManager.ts
    ├── refreshScheduler.ts
    ├── sessionManager.ts
    ├── anonymousUser.ts
    ├── userSettings.ts
    ├── featureFlags.ts
    └── commands.ts
```

## Getting Started

To begin implementing the authentication system, start with Phase 1 (Infrastructure Setup) and proceed through each phase sequentially. Each phase builds upon the previous one, so it's important to complete them in order.

## Testing

Each phase includes specific testing requirements. The final phase (Testing & Polish) includes comprehensive testing of the entire authentication system, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.
